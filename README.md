# LiquidHaskell Flake

Provides overlays for `ghc947`.

This is simply a continuation of the previously first-party [liquidhaskell flake](https://github.com/ucsd-progsys/liquidhaskell/blob/f917323a1f9db1677e592d6ffc81467d53588d70/flake.nix) and [liquid-fixpoint flake](https://github.com/ucsd-progsys/liquid-fixpoint/blob/544f8b0ba6d03b060701961250cce012412039c4/flake.nix), both provided by [@plredmond](https://github.com/plredmond). For similar reasons, there is no guarantee of updates.
